              When the very first sans-serif Typefaces were introduced in the
              Mid 1880s they were regarded as ugly and an insult for the renewed
              graphic designer. The term Â»GroteskÂ« was meant to disqualify the
              typefaces. These typefaces were controversial, highly misregarded
              and bad reputed. They were seen as a protest against all
              ornamental and historically coloured typefaces. They were an
              uprising against conservative values. Protest Grotesk pays homage
              to these Typefaces. Nowadays quality can not only stem from formal
              design-descisions. A typeface has to rely on a strong technical
              foundation, in order to deliver an advantage to modern-day type
              users. Protest Grotesk is placed right into thes field of tension.

                There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
                Inhale, in hell there's heaven

                Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
                And catch a solo, on time
                White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
                And that mean cheap, cause ain't shit free and I know it
                Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
                But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
                Now your baby momma ain't so vicious, all she want is her picket fence
                And you protest and you picket sign, but them courts won't side with you
                Won't let you fly solo
                I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
                I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
                Stayed up 'til my phone died
                Smoking big, rolling solo"

            <p>&#8594; INFORMATION</p>
            <p>
              When the very first sans-serif Typefaces were introduced in the
              Mid 1880s they were regarded as ugly and an insult for the renewed
              graphic designer. The term Â»GroteskÂ« was meant to disqualify the
              typefaces. These typefaces were controversial, highly misregarded
              and bad reputed. They were seen as a protest against all
              ornamental and historically coloured typefaces. They were an
              uprising against conservative values. Protest Grotesk pays homage
              to these Typefaces. Nowadays quality can not only stem from formal
              design-descisions. A typeface has to rely on a strong technical
              foundation, in order to deliver an advantage to modern-day type
              users. Protest Grotesk is placed right into thes field of tension.
