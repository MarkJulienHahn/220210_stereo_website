            <p>&#8594; INFORMATION</p>
            <p>
              When the very first sans-serif Typefaces were introduced in the
              Mid 1880s they were regarded as ugly and an insult for the renewed
              graphic designer. The term Â»GroteskÂ« was meant to disqualify the
              typefaces. These typefaces were controversial, highly misregarded
              and bad reputed. They were seen as a protest against all
              ornamental and historically coloured typefaces. They were an
              uprising against conservative values. Giallo Roman pays homage to
              these Typefaces. Nowadays quality can not only stem from formal
              design-descisions. A typeface has to rely on a strong technical
              foundation, in order to deliver an advantage to modern-day type
              users. Giallo Roman is placed right into thes field of tension.

              When the very first sans-serif Typefaces were introduced in the
              Mid 1880s they were regarded as ugly and an insult for the renewed
              graphic designer. The term Â»GroteskÂ« was meant to disqualify the
              typefaces. These typefaces were controversial, highly misregarded
              and bad reputed. They were seen as a protest against all
              ornamental and historically coloured typefaces. They were an
              uprising against conservative values. Giallo Roman pays homage to
              these Typefaces. Nowadays quality can not only stem from formal
              design-descisions. A typeface has to rely on a strong technical
              foundation, in order to deliver an advantage to modern-day type
              users. Giallo Roman is placed right into thes field of tension.
